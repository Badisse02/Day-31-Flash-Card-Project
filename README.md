# Day-31-Flash-Card-Project
If you want to practice english or french or any other language, you can use this program and just modify the data of the program.
in this project, we are using the tkinter module to create a GUI that displays a word in french and give you five seconds to guess the right meaning in english and after it will show you the correct answer. If you were correct click on the right button, if not click on the left one and in these two cases it will go to the next word.
In the unknown_words.csv, you will find the words that you didn't know them.
It's time to level up your englishðŸ˜‰, so let's GO ðŸ’ª !
